Hi o/

Now I mainly write mods for Vintage Story game. All of their source code is available in the repositories on my **[GitHub](https://github.com/DArkHekRoMaNT?tab=repositories)** (except for very simple ones) and are distributed under the MIT license. Also a full list of my mods can be found here: **[Vintage Story's ModDB](https://mods.vintagestory.at/list/mod?userid=8)**.

If you like what I do, you can support me at **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/darkhekromant)** or **[DonationAlerts](https://www.donationalerts.com/r/darkhekromant)**
